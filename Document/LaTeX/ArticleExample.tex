\begin{abstract}
\noindent
In an earlier Insight Journal article, we introduced an ITK implementation of the
adaptive patch-based image denoising algorithm described in \cite{Manjon:2010aa}.
We follow-up up that offering with a generalized non-local, patch-based ITK class
framework and a refactored denoising class.  In addition, we provide two
ITK implementations of related, well-known algorithms.  The first is a non-local
super resolution method described in \cite{Manjon:2010ab,Manjon:2010ac}.  The second is
the multivariate
joint label fusion algorithm of \cite{Wang:2013ab,Wang:2013aa} with additional extensions,
denoted as ``joint intensity fusion'', which will be described in a forthcoming manuscript.
Accompanying these ITK classes are
documented programming interfaces which use our previously introduced unique
command line interface routines.  Several 2-D examples on brain imaging data are
provided to qualitatively demonstrate performance.

\section{Introduction}

Since the non-local (NL) means algorithm introduced in several early papers \cite{Buades},
the resulting family of research techniques has grown to significant prominence within the
medical imaging community.  In addition to continued research output, patch-based techniques
have been the subject of workshops (Patch-MI 2015 and PMI'16, both MICCAI-sponsored
workshops).   Given the interest and potential applications, this submission is a potential
``conversation starter'' for the development of an ITK software framework

\section{ITK Implementation}

The following files define the adaptive NL-means algorithm and is written in ITK
coding style:
\begin{itemize}
  \item itkAdaptiveNonLocalMeansDenoisingImageFilter.h
  \item itkAdaptiveNonLocalMeansDenoisingImageFilter.hxx
\end{itemize}
The following helper class
\begin{itemize}
  \item itkVarianceImageFilter.h
  \item itkVarianceImageFilter.hxx
\end{itemize}
is the variance analog to the \doxygen{MeanImageFilter} which ``Computes an image where a
given pixel is the [variance] value of the the pixels in a neighborhood about the corresponding
input pixel.''  Both the adaptive and variance filters are multi-threaded.

Additionally, we wrote an easy-to-use interface program, DenoiseImage.cxx, with an ANTs-based command
line interface facilitated by the following helper classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item antsCommandLineOption.h
  \item antsCommandLineOption.cxx
  \item antsCommandLineParser.h
  \item antsCommandLineParser.cxx
\end{itemize}
These latter files are not essential for other applications or for inclusion into ITK.
They are included simply to facilitate the generation of a stand-alone application that
people can use.  One can invoke the help menu via \verb#$ DenoiseImage --help 1# at the
command line:
\small
\begin{verbatim}
$ DenoiseImage --help 1

COMMAND:
     DenoiseImage
          Denoise an image using a spatially adaptive filter originally described in J. V.
          Manjon, P. Coupe, Luis Marti-Bonmati, D. L. Collins, and M. Robles. Adaptive
          Non-Local Means Denoising of MR Images With Spatially Varying Noise Levels,
          Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 31:192-203, June 2010.

OPTIONS:
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3/4
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If
          not specified, the program tries to infer the dimensionality from the input
          image.

     -i, --input-image inputImageFilename
          A scalar image is expected as input for noise correction.

     -n, --noise-model Rician/(Gaussian)
          Employ a Rician or Gaussian noise model.

     -x, --mask-image maskImageFilename
          If a mask image is specified, denoising is only performed in the mask region.

     -s, --shrink-factor (1)/2/3/...
          Running noise correction on large images can be time consuming. To lessen
          computation time, the input image can be resampled. The shrink factor, specified
          as a single integer, describes this resampling. Shrink factor = 1 is the
          default.

     -p, --patch-radius 1
                        1x1x1
          Patch radius. Default = 1x1x1

     -r, --search-radius 3
                         3x3x3
          Search radius. Default = 3x3x3.

     -o, --output correctedImage
                  [correctedImage,<noiseImage>]
          The output consists of the noise corrected version of the input image.
          Optionally, one can also output the estimated noise image.

     -v, --verbose (0)/1
          Verbose output.

     -h
          Print the help menu (short version).

     --help
          Print the help menu.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
which should provide minimal detail regarding each parameter.  The default parameters
should provide adequate performance for a variety of cases thus requiring only the simple
call (for a 3-D image)

\small
\begin{verbatim}
$ DenoiseImage -d 3 -i ${inputImage} -o ${outputImage}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

As mentioned, this filter is multi-threaded so one might want to set the environment
variable to enable more than one thread, e.g.,
\small
\begin{verbatim}
$ export ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS=4
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

To see the progress of the filter, one also needs to set the verbose flag, i.e.,
\verb#-v 1#.

\section{Examples}

We included a 2-D brain slice and a 3-D hyperpolarized gas volume each with a corresponding
mask.  Below we include the call and resulting output for these two sets of data.
