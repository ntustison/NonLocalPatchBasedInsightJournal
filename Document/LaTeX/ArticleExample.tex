\begin{abstract}
\noindent
In an earlier Insight Journal article, we introduced an ITK implementation of the
adaptive patch-based image denoising algorithm described in \cite{Manjon:2010aa}.
We follow-up up that offering with a generalized non-local, patch-based ITK class
framework and a refactored denoising class.  In addition, we provide two
ITK implementations of related, well-known algorithms.  The first is a non-local
super resolution method described in \cite{Manjon:2010ab,Manjon:2010ac}.  The second is
the multivariate
joint label fusion algorithm of \cite{Wang:2013ab,Wang:2013aa} with additional extensions,
denoted as ``joint intensity fusion'', which will be described in a forthcoming manuscript.
Accompanying these ITK classes are
documented programming interfaces which use our previously introduced unique
command line interface routines.  Several 2-D examples on brain imaging data are
provided to qualitatively demonstrate performance.

\section{Introduction}

Since the non-local (NL) means algorithm introduced in several early papers,
the resulting family of research techniques has grown to significant prominence within the
medical imaging community.  In addition to continued research output, patch-based techniques
have been the subject of workshops (Patch-MI 2015 and PMI'16, both MICCAI-sponsored
workshops).   Given the interest and potential applications, this submission is a potential
``conversation starter'' for the development of an ITK software framework for accommodating
such techniques.

\section{ITK Implementation}

\subsection{Parent and child classes}

Based on the implementations of different algorithms from the various authors,
the common routines were grouped to the following parent class:

\begin{itemize}
  \item itkNonLocalPatchBasedImageFilter.h
  \item itkNonLocalPatchBasedImageFilter.hxx
\end{itemize}

The common routines contained within this class include defining both the
patch and search neighborhoods.  We also define two patch similarity
metrics---sum of squared differences (SSD) and Pearson's correlation.
We also provide methods for ``vectorizing'' image patches and multiple image
patches (for multi-modal applications) for facilitating similarity metric
calculation.

We provide the following classes for the adaptive denoising algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
  \item itkAdaptiveNonLocalMeansDenoisingImageFilter.h
  \item itkAdaptiveNonLocalMeansDenoisingImageFilter.hxx
\end{itemize}
The following helper class
\begin{itemize}
  \item itkVarianceImageFilter.h
  \item itkVarianceImageFilter.hxx
\end{itemize}
These have been refactored since our previous contribution such that the
adaptive denoising class is derived from the parent class.  Again, the
second class is the variance analog to the \doxygen{MeanImageFilter}
which ``Computes an image where a
given pixel is the [variance] value of the the pixels in a neighborhood about the corresponding
input pixel.''

For the super-resolution algorithm, we provide the following class:
\begin{itemize}
  \item itkNonLocalSuperresolutionImageFilter.h
  \item itkNonLocalSuperresolutionImageFilter.hxx
\end{itemize}
which subsumes functionalities described in both \cite{Manjon:2010ab,Manjon:2010ac}.

Finally, for the joint fusion algorithm \cite{Wang:2013ab,Wang:2013aa} we provide
the following class:
\begin{itemize}
  \item itkWeightedVotingFusionImageFilter.h
  \item itkWeightedVotingFusionImageFilter.hxx
\end{itemize}

Note that all classes are multi-threaded.

\subsection{Programs}

We provide the following routines which use the above-listed classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item DenoiseImage.cxx
  \item NonLocalSuperResolution.cxx
  \item jointFusion.cxx
\end{itemize}

All these routines use an ANTs-based command line interface facilitated by the
following helper classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item antsCommandLineOption.h
  \item antsCommandLineOption.cxx
  \item antsCommandLineParser.h
  \item antsCommandLineParser.cxx
\end{itemize}
These latter files are not essential for other applications or for inclusion into ITK.
They are included simply to facilitate the generation of a stand-alone application that
people can use.

One can invoke the help menu for all these routines via the \verb#--help# option invoked at the
command line.  To see the progress of the filter, one also needs to set the verbose flag, i.e.,
\verb#-v 1#.  Below we give the help menu for each program.

\subsection{Denoise image}

\small
\begin{verbatim}
$ DenoiseImage --help 1

COMMAND:
     DenoiseImage
          Denoise an image using a spatially adaptive filter originally described in J. V.
          Manjon, P. Coupe, Luis Marti-Bonmati, D. L. Collins, and M. Robles. Adaptive
          Non-Local Means Denoising of MR Images With Spatially Varying Noise Levels,
          Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 31:192-203, June 2010.

OPTIONS:
     -d, --image-dimensionality 2/3/4
          This option forces the image to be treated as a specified-dimensional image. If
          not specified, the program tries to infer the dimensionality from the input
          image.

     -i, --input-image inputImageFilename
          A scalar image is expected as input for noise correction.

     -n, --noise-model Rician/(Gaussian)
          Employ a Rician or Gaussian noise model.

     -x, --mask-image maskImageFilename
          If a mask image is specified, denoising is only performed in the mask region.

     -s, --shrink-factor (1)/2/3/...
          Running noise correction on large images can be time consuming. To lessen
          computation time, the input image can be resampled. The shrink factor, specified
          as a single integer, describes this resampling. Shrink factor = 1 is the
          default.

     -p, --patch-radius 1
                        1x1x1
          Patch radius. Default = 1x1x1

     -r, --search-radius 3
                         3x3x3
          Search radius. Default = 3x3x3.

     -o, --output correctedImage
                  [correctedImage,<noiseImage>]
          The output consists of the noise corrected version of the input image.
          Optionally, one can also output the estimated noise image.

     -v, --verbose (0)/1
          Verbose output.

     -j, --interpolated-image inputImageFilename

          as the low-resolution input image (i.e., registered).One should specify either

          original label fusion framework was extended to accommodate intensities by Brian
          Avants. This implementation is based on Paul's original ITK-style implementation
          and Brian's ANTsR implementation. References include 1) H. Wang, J. W. Suh, S.
